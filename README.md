# LC-CS-Project

This is my LC project for computer science. Unfortunatley I cannot share the code without compramising the private key for my firebase account.
Hence to avoid any discrepencies with my examination of this project in June, i opted to just commit the video. 

The video has all the information about the website, its features, technologies ect...

I applied what I learnt from making my graphing calculator website and made sure every line of code is readable and top notch.
